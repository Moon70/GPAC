GPAC - a color quantizer (color reduction algorithm)
==
**GPAC** stands for 'Gif Piece A Change'.

The name came up while listening to the album 'Shaved Fish' by John Lennon.



I needed a color quantizer for the [Ganimed](https://github.com/Moon70/Ganimed) tool, because i wasn´t satisfied with Java´s GIF image quality.

This project is intended to become a playground to fiddle around with own ideas to further improve image quality.

The primary goal is to have fun doing so, instead of just implementing the best and most complex algorithm found on the internet :-)  I´ll create a WIKI for that, it´s somewhere on my todo list.



This version comes with a simple commandline interface:

`java -jar gpac-1.0.0.jar whatever.png`

This creates `whatever.gif` in the samer folder.
